<h1>Use OpenPGP Keys for OpenSSH, how to use gpg with ssh</h1>
This is <a href="http://www.programmierecke.net">www.programmierecke.net</a>, section <a href="http://www.programmierecke.net/howto/">howto</a>, feedback to: <a href="mailto:segler_alex@web.de">segler_alex AT web DOT de</a><br/>
My test system is Ubuntu Lucid 10.04

<H2>Disable gnome keyring for GPG and SSH in Ubuntu 11.10</H2>
This applies to all things below if you are using Ubuntu 11.10.<br/>
To disable the keyring services you have to look at /etc/xdg/autostart. I just renamed "gnome-keyring-ssh.desktop" -> "gnome-keyring-ssh.nostart" and "gnome-keyring-gpg.desktop" -> "gnome-keyring-gpg.nostart"

<h2>Without smartcard</h2>

<h3>change agent to gpg-agent</h3>
you do not have to do this, but every other agent does need to register your key with it every session again.<br/>
gpg-agent remembers the once added key and you never have to register it again.<br/>
Not using gpg-agent, has the disadvantage of having to register the key every login-session with "monkeysphere s" again.
<br/><br/>
DON'T do this on ubuntu 10.04! ubuntu 10.04 uses a broken version of gpg-agent: 2.0.14. DON'T use this version on any other distribution. It will not work. gpg-agent has a bug in 2.0.14. (<a href="https://bugs.g10code.com/gnupg/issue1184">https://bugs.g10code.com/gnupg/issue1184</a>, <a href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/gnupg2/+bug/567106">Bug on Launchpad</a>) Use ssh-agent or gnome-keyring-daemon instead.
<pre>
# install gpg-agent
apt-get install gnupg-agent

# deactivate gnome-keyring-daemon ssh-agent dropin-replacement, we want only gpg-agent
# VERY OLD versions of ubuntu (uses gconf settings for autostart)
gconftool-2 --type bool --set /apps/gnome-keyring/daemon-components/ssh false
# newer ubuntu < 12.04 (uses xdg autostart)
mkdir ~/config/autostart
echo "X-GNOME-Autostart-enabled=false" > ~/.config/autostart/gnome-keyring-gpg.desktop
echo "X-GNOME-Autostart-enabled=false" > ~/.config/autostart/gnome-keyring-ssh.desktop

# ubuntu >= 12.04 (uses upstart override)
echo manual >> ~/.config/upstart/gnome-keyring.override


# maybe you have to deactivate ssh-agent too,
# if you are using some older ubuntu version, or ssh-agent keeps interfering
# this is done somewhere in /etc/X11/Xsession.options

# configure gpg to use agent (only for smartcard)
echo "use-agent" >> ~/.gnupg/gpg.conf

# enable ssh-agent drop in replacement support for gpg-agent
echo "enable-ssh-support" >> ~/.gnupg/gpg-agent.conf

# on ubuntu >= 13.10 (uses upstart) you have to override the broken gpg-agent start script
mkdir ~/.init
wget http://www.programmierecke.net/howto/gpg-agent.conf -O ~/.init/gpg-agent.conf

# logout, login
# gpg-agent should now start
# check with:
ps aux | grep gpg-agent
# check gpg-agent ssh-features
set | grep SSH
</pre>
<h3>register key with your agent</h3>
<pre>
# please install package "monkeysphere" for this. it will be easier then.
sudo apt-get install monkeysphere

# secure gnupg homedir
chmod -R go-rwx ~/.gnupg

# create authentication subkey
#  only do this, if you haven't created a authentication subkey yet
monkeysphere g

# export gpg key to agent
monkeysphere s
# check if the key got added to the agent.
# this command should show your added key.
ssh-add -l

# search for authentication subkey-id
# one of the subkeys that are displayed now, has "usage: A" for authentication
gpg --edit-key mail@example.com
quit

# EXAMPLE output of gpg --edit-key mail@...
# this example has the authentication subkey-id: "695A85B3"

<h3>step by step</h3>
Don't install/use monkeysphere. it does not work with authentication keys on smartcards.
<pre>
# install needed packages
# gpgsm package is needed, because we need "scdaemon" = smartcard-daemon
apt-get install gpgsm
# gpg-agent is needed because it is the only possibility to use a authentication subkey directly from the smartcard
apt-get install gnupg-agent

# deactivate gnome-keyring-daemon ssh-agent dropin-replacement, we want only gpg-agent
# VERY OLD versions of ubuntu (uses gconf settings for autostart)

quit

# calling gpg a second time is needed, that gpg fully recognizes the key on the card
# remember the last 8 characters of the line starting with "Authentication key:"

# secure gnupg homedir

# testing ssh, it should ask for a PIN now, if you have one
ssh -v user@testhost

# it should work now
</pre>
<h3>bugs i encountered</h3>
* DON'T try to use smartcard, if it is not connected. it will destroy scdaemon and you will either have to logout and login again or to do: "killall -9 scdaemon". this happens after reconnecting the smartcard:
<pre>
# gpg --card-status
gpg: selecting openpgp failed: ec=6.108
gpg: OpenPGP card not available: general error
</pre>
